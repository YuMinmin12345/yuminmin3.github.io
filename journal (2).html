<p>As a child, Taylor Swift lived on an 11 acre Christmas tree farm in Wyoming, Pennsylvania. When she was 10 years old, she wrote a three page poem the monster in my closet, which won the National Poetry Contest . In the same year, he began to perform in Philadelphia and surrounding areas. At the age of 11,he performed the American national anthem before the NBA Philadelphia 76ers.</p> 
    
<p>In 2001, after watching the program of country singer Faith Hill on TV, she had the idea of becoming a country singer and going to Nashville, USA . After learning chords, she wrote her first song lucky you. In the same year, I drove to Nashville with my family and went to the music street with many record companies to send original music samples to the front desk of each record company.</p>
                
<p>Taylor Swift's parents moved to Nashville to help her daughter pursue her music dream. In 2003, after presenting original songs to RCA, Taylor Swift got a contract and started his music career. However, Taylor Swift, 15, couldn't accept the plan to wait three years for another record to be released, so he left the company. </p>
