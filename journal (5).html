                <h3>Taylor Swift is not only a powerful singer with creative talent, but also an idol singer with beautiful appearance. Her music style inherits the traditional American country music, but also adds R & B, dance music, rock and roll and other fashion elements to the details. On the basis of traditional country music, Taylor Swift uses fashion elements to create and disseminate country music, making it fashionable and easy to be accepted. She has made outstanding contributions in promoting the fashion and urbanization of country music (review by Shenzhen business daily)</h3>
                <h3>Taylor Swift has beautiful and shiny golden hair, white skin, tall figure and upright posture, just like an "American sweetheart", innocent and optimistic (review of the Bund pictorial). She has an indelible temperament of country music and is the "image spokesperson" of the youth of American country music. As a singer songwriter, her music and singing life are as natural and bright as the country, and as generous and frank as a simple country girl. Her voice is full of tension, maturity and skill, and at the same time, it is full of youth, vitality and boldness (Beijing Times review). She not only has the ability to write songs, but also plays guitar, piano and other musical instruments. In addition, her honesty, elegance, fraternity and perseverance inspired audiences all over the world(comment by Mark Dayton, governor of Minnesota, USA). </h3>
